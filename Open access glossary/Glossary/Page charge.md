# Page charge

One of a number of supplementary charges imposed by some journals to cover the cost of publishing, and charged in addition to article processing charges (APCs).

Models for charging vary, with some charging a fee per page for all pages, and some having an initial maximum allowance (eg 6 pages) and then charge for additional pages. Prices vary considerably between journals. The journal will not usually publish the paper until page charges have been paid. Not all journals charge page charges. Page charges can occur for open access (OA) and non-OA articles.

# Article processing charge

Fee paid to journals to publish an article as open access.

Fee paid to journals to publish an article as open access (OA). They are most often paid by the author's institutions or research funder. The article processing charge (APC) covers the publisher's processing and publishing costs for the OA article and to generate income. An APC is an alternative method of covering costs and income generation to the traditional subscription model of payment to access or receive journal content. Not all OA or hybrid journals charge an APC for OA publication: some use other models to cover costs such as sponsorship. In reputable journals APCs differ from vanity publishing because of robust quality control such as peer review that precedes publication.

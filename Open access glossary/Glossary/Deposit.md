# Deposit

The action of uploading a digital copy of a work into a digital repository or similar service by the author(s) or their agent, together with metadata that, ideally, supports FAIR principles (Findable; Accessible; Interoperable; Re-usable).

Deposit does not imply the work is freely available, embargoed, or published. Deposit of a work in a repository is sometimes referred to as “self-archiving”.

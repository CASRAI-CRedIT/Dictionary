# Submission fee

Charge levied on author(s) upon submission of a manuscript to a journal, sometimes referred to as administrative or handling charges.

They are typically non-refundable (although there can be some exceptions). Submission fees should be distinguished from charges levied on acceptance of the article such as the article processing charge (APC) in open access journals, or colour charges or page charges in subscription-based journals. Submission fees can occur for open access (OA) and non-OA articles.

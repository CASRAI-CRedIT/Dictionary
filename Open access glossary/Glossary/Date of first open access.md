# Date of first open access

The date that a work was first made publicly available on an Open Access (OA) basis. For example, this could be the date that a copy of the work was made live (discoverable) on an OA basis on a repository or may be triggered when an embargo period expires. It could also be when an work was available on a publisher web site, or elsewhere, on an OA basis.

# Publication permission

The circumstances under which copyright material may be used and where permission must be sought from the copyright holder.

Once a paper has been published by a journal, an author or other interested party may wish to submit it for inclusion in another publisher's journal or to incorporate some or all of its elements in another work. It is necessary to secure the copyright holder's permission to have such material published in another source. Journals and other publishers of content will set out the circumstances under which permission must be sought in respect to using copyrighted material. Permission may be required to post online, reuse, reprint, publicly display, photocopy or otherwise reproduce for any purpose, including access via an open access (OA) repository.

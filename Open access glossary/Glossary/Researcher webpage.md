# Researcher webpage

A webpage featuring a researcher's profile, which possibly may also provide links to their publications.

The webpage is hosted on the website of the researcher's employer – for example, a university website. There may or may not be a direct connection between the institutional webpage and the same institution's repository (see “Institutional repository”), but researchers should generally ensure that their works are deposited in a repository in order to meet the Open Access requirements of many funders, due to the potential for differences in approach to long-term preservation and access between the managers of a repository and the managers of an institutional website.

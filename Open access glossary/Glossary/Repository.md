# Repository

Repositories preserve, manage, and provide access to many types of digital materials in a variety of formats.

Materials in online repositories are curated to enable search, discovery, and reuse. There must be sufficient control for the digital material to be authentic, reliable, accessible and usable on a continuing basis.

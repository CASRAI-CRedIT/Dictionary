# Date of compliant deposit

Date on which a copy of a version of a work and its metadata is in a repository (or equivalent) and meets the requirements of a mandate, policy, piece of legislation etc.

Date on which a copy of a version of a work and its metadata is in a repository (or equivalent) and meets the requirements of a mandate or policy. In the UK context HEFCE, RCUK and individual funder and institutional policies may differ in their definition of compliance. The date of compliant deposit is the date on which a record meets those requirements and therefore, there may be multiple “dates of compliant deposit” in respect of a single work. Date of “first compliant deposit” for HEFCE REF 2021 is when a record that meets the requirements of the policy is deposited in a repository that also meets the requirements of the policy.

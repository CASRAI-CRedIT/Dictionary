# Date of online availability

The date that a work was first made available online. This may be before or after the publication date.

This applies to any online availability of the content of the work where the term “publication” is not appropriate. This is applicable where the type-of-work isn't usually published – a practice-based output or thesis, for example, or if the platform is a social or subject networking site. Where a work is subsequently published this term would only be used if the content is substantially the same as that that was made available online.

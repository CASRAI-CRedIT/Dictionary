# Date of acceptance

The day on which the publisher or evaluation institution or committee confirms formally that the article has been received from the author and no substantial changes to the content are required. Also the date on which the publisher tells the author that the article will be published and the article is ready to be processed for publication.

Some publishers may write to authors saying they will be accepted if some changes are made â€“ this is not the acceptance date. After all changes to the text have been agreed between author and publisher the acceptance date is when the publisher confirms that the document is ready to be processed by the publisher.

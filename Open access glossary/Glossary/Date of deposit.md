# Date of deposit

Date on which a copy of a version of a work and its metadata is deposited in a repository (or equivalent). Not necessarily the same as the date that the work becomes discoverable. A period of time may elapse after deposit, but before the record is made publicly available during which the record may be checked for accuracy and compliance by repository administration staff and an embargo may be applied.

### The CASRAI information model

CASRAI, through its unique working group centered process, constructed a model for some business documents in the domain of research:
* [Abridged Academic CV](./Templates/CV%20-%20Abridged%20Academic.md)
* [Full Academic CV](./Templates/CV%20-%20Full%20Academic.md)
* [DMP Ethics Review](./Templates/DMP%20Ethics%20Review.md)
* [Open Access APC Report](./Templates/Open%20Access%20APC%20Report.md)

These are the top-level ones that were defined.
The two CVs share a total of 19 sections and subsections, which are also listed under [Templates](./Templates/).

The Templates use 123 [Objects](./Objects/) as basic building blocks.
These objects have 1,035 ([Object fields](./Object-Fields)) properties in total.
Some of these properties may use controlled vocabularies, the 10 [Picklists](./Picklists/).
